Markov decision process (MDP) is a discrete time stochastic control process. The following program defines a Markov Decision Problem for a generic grid world. A value iteration algorithm is used to print the values of states in each iteration. After termination of the value iteration, the final policy is printed. The basic idea is to calculate the utility of each state and then use the state utilities to select an optimal action in each state.
The modified policy iteration algorithm is also used to calculate and print the optimal policy for a given grid world. The description of the MDP, is loaded as an input from a text file. The project has been implemented in Java.
